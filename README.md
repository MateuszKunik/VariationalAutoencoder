# VariationalAutoencoder

This repository contains the implementation of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
VAE is a powerful generative model that can be used for unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and data generation tasks.
It leverages the concept of latent variables to learn a compact representation of the input data distribution.
